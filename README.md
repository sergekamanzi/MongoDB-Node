## Project Description

**Purchase Booking App** is a fullstack web application that allows users to book travel packages by submitting details such as check-in/out dates, guest information, and contact details through a responsive React form. The backend, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, securely stores booking data and sends automated email confirmations to users upon successful submission using Nodemailer. The system ensures smooth communication, real-time data handling, and clean UI/UX for seamless travel reservations.
